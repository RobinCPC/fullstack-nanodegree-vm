Virtual Machine for Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Program
=============

This repo contains common code for the Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses.
During this program, I had completed couples of project about fullstack, includes:
1. Applied a PostgreSQL relational database scheme to store the results of a game tournament.  
  [Here](./vagrant/tournament/) is the project folder.
2. Built a RESTful web application that queries a database for items and generates the form of web pages.  
  [Here](./vagrant/introCRUD/) is the project folder.
3. Created an interactive resume web page that reads your resume content from a JSON file.
  This project is storaged in different repo, please visit the [repo](https://github.com/RobinCPC/frontend-nanodegree-resume), and the [webpage](http://robincpc.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-resume/)
